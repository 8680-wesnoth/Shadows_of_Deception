Installing NX-RPG
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Released versions of NX-RPG should be installed from Battle for Wesnoth’s
official add-ons servers, via Battle for Wesnoth’s built-in add-ons manager,
which can be accessed via the “Add-ons Manager” button in the main menu.

Players who know how to use [Git] [2] and are interested in testing the latest
(unstable, buggy) version of NX-RPG may clone our Git repository, which is to
be found [on GitHub] [3], into Battle for Wesnoth’s
“[userdata][4]/data/add-ons/” directory.

Installing lp8
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NX-RPG: Shadows of Deception requires another Battle for Wesnoth add-on,
8680’s Lua Pack (internally referred to as “lp8”).

A copy of lp8 is included with the released versions of NX-RPG that are made
available on Battle for Wesnoth’s official add-ons servers.

Players who install NX-RPG via Git must install lp8 manually. If you install
NX-RPG via Git, you should either:

* Install lp8 via Battle for Wesnoth’s add-ons manager, or…
* Clone lp8’s Git repository (which is also [on GitHub] [5]) into the same
  directory into which you cloned NX-RPG’s Git repository.
