Plot summary:
-------------
Mizenwyn sees the state of the empire, and decides take it over, out of personal desire for power and hubris. He begins capturing, with the help of his undead, a few minor officials in the kingdom, slowly working his way up the chain of command, eventually corrupting noblemen within Weldyn itself. However, there is a slip. Niryone becomes suspicious due to the Rhayn's (Niryone and Elynia's traveling companion) reaction to healing magic. She realizes he is an impersonator, and destroys him. She and Elynia then investigate, gradually gather more and more info, eventually almost seeing Mizenwyn's full plot. 

Niryone goes to the Ka'lian in Wesmere for help. On the way, they are ambused by some silent masked warriors. When the group finally reaches the Ka'lain, they decline on grounds of not enough solid evidence and the fact that they have their hands full with a random necromancer and his pirate/bandit allies attacking western Aethenwood, for reasons undisclosed.

Mizenwyn realizes Niryone and co could expose him before he has secured his place on the throne. He cannot kill her, or he will have the entire elvish civilization after him. He cannot capture her, as she a powerful elvish sorceress with power to rival his own.

Instead, he captures the king. The economy is failing, popular opinion of the crown is divided, and now the king has disappeared. Other rebellious lords (other than Mizenwyn, that is) see their chance at dominion. And so sparks a civil war, with the crown forces (some of which are doppelgangers) and the remaining loyal lords on one side, and each rebel lord on his own side (except those that are doppelgangers, which are presumably working together in secret).

Mizenwyn then casts a spell on himself, to disguise himself as the king, and casts a spell on an apprentice to make him appear to be Mizenwyn. He tells his minions to hide the real king until the time comes, then kill him. Mizenwyn then travels to the cave system in the Heart Mountains where the rest of his prisoners are being kept, and waits. He deliberately lets Niryone continue to discover his original plot of invading Wledyn while civil war was in force and taking the throne. 

Rhyan then escapes prison, after finally having woken from a magic-induced coma. On his way out, he finds Galamor. They leave the cave, and assist a wandering dwarf back to his main force. They are attacked by a band of masked warriors, and are forced to retaliate.

Meanwhile, Niryone has been traveling North on a lead she had found. This leads her smack dab into the middle of the conflict between the orcs and dwarves. She and Elynia help drive them back, after which they hold a meeting with an allied orcish chieftain from the Northern Alliance, Galamor, Rhyan, and the leader of the dwarves Rhyan helped. They realize Mizenwyn is keeping his prisoners in the very facility Rhyan and Galamor escaped from. They return to free the rest.

After Niryone and co find and free the prisoners, including the disguised Mizenwyn, they hurry back to Weldyn and attempt to stop Mizenwyn's double from taking the throne. They succeed, and place who they consider to be the real King back on the throne. However, he is actually Mizenwyn in disguise, a fact which he then reveals.

Nine years later, Mizenwyn finally poses enough of a threat to the civilizations of the Great Continent that the Ka'lian and Northern Alliance want him eliminated. They choose Niryone and her band to do the job as a way for them to atone for their massive mistake. The Northern Alliance agrees to skirmish the northern border of the Empire to allow Niryone and co to infiltrate the palace undetected. She accepts.

Galamor is one of the leaders of the skirmishing troops. This job he does well, attracting more and more of Wesnoth's military to attack him and his allies, which results in few to oppose Niryone's group as they cross the Ford of Abez.

Eventually, Niryone's group manages to infiltrate the palace and navigate to Mizenwyn's location. An epic battle commences between Mizenwyn, Niryone, and Elynia. In the process, Niryone is mortally wounded. She tells Elynia with her last breath to use the SoF against their enemies. Elynia then manages to grab the SoF from Mizenwyn's hand, and use it to finally kill him. The First Empire of Wesnoth is dissolved, and Mizenwyn's minions executed. An impromptu Council of War orders the SoF destroyed. Elynia agrees to do so, and takes it deep into Knalga to have it disassembled. However, she changes her mind, and instead bribes the crafters to graft it to Niryone's staff in place of the jewel already there. She then casts an amnesia spell on them, and returns to Weldyn a year later, reporting her mission accomplished.
