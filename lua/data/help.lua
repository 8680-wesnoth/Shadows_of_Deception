Many elements of this campaign differ from standard Wesnoth. Many of these elements are derived from the SurvivalXtreme (SX) add-on; if you have played that, some differences may be familiar. If you aren’t sure if I’ve implemented something differently, look here; this should explain.

Tips:
• Read the objectives — there may be special win conditions.
• Don’t try to eradicate all the enemies — they may be respawning.
• Explore — there may be hidden areas.]]
