            story= _ "Around 1046 YW, many events which would later lead to the consolidation of Wesnoth as the dominant empire on the Great Continent of Irdya began to take place. For many years after the defeat of human and elvish forces at the hands of Black-Eye Kapou’e’, the Great Continent rested beneath a blanket of relative tranquility. Excepting the occasional skirmish, the elvish, human, dwarvish, and orcish kingdoms were at peace. But it was not to last. Though none then knew, this was the beginning of the final age of Wesnoth. Its domain would expand one last time, before its definitive end in the fiery cataclysm that would mark the dawn of the Golden Age of Irdya."

            story= _ "In 1063 YW, a new king, Konrad III, acceded to the throne of Wesnoth. For several years, the peace that had endured for the past century has been shattering. Merchant caravans were hijacked, orcs and dwarves battled, outlying towns were sacked and burned. The new king inherited a land throughout which seeds of disaster were sown rife, and, inexperienced as he was, could do naught to quash their blossoming. Unrest spread across the continent. Trade evaporated. To the northeast, Lintanir burned in the fires of civil war. On the fringes of the Wesnothian empire, and even in the heartland, local lords ruled their fiefdoms as nations unto themselves, heeding not the edicts of the crown."

She taught me many things, and raised me as her own since my mother died. She was a great sorceress, skilled in the arts of faerie magic, and helped me greatly in my training. Though we traveled a good deal, nothing of very much importance happened during my early years. That all changed with the events that were about to occur, events of which I will now relate. Hear now, my story."

Then there were the various accounts from the townspeople of several strange events around the area lately. Seemingly unrelated ... but were they?"
